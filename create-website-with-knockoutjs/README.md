# created static website using knockoutjs
A Website template with left Nav, new HTML pages can be configured and added to Json file.
You can add new html file to data/allarticles.json file.
There on JSON file where you just need to configure your new HTML file and action, rest of the things will be taken care by the code.
I developed this code just for the purpose of learning KnockoutJS framework.
