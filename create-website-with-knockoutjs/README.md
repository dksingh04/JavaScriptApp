# created static website using knockoutjs
A Website template with left Navigation. New HTML pages can be configured and added to Json file.
You can find the configuration file in data/allarticles.json file.
In configuration file you just need to add your new HTML file location (relative path) and action, rest of the things will be taken care by the code.
I developed this code just for the purpose of learning KnockoutJS framework.
